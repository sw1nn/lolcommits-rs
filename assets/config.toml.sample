# Font names for different text elements (resolved via fontconfig)
# All default to "monospace" which uses the system monospace font

# Path to the background image
# This image will be composited behind the segmented person
#
# If the path starts with '/', it's treated as an absolute path.
# Otherwise, it's treated as a basename and will search for {basename}.png in:
#   - XDG_DATA_HOME (typically ~/.local/share)
#   - XDG_DATA_DIRS (typically /usr/local/share:/usr/share)
# Searching in subdirectories: backgrounds/, pixmaps/, wallpapers/, or the root
#
# Examples:
#   background_path = "/home/user/.local/share/backgrounds/my-bg.png"  (absolute path)
#   background_path = "GoogleMeetBackground"                           (searches for GoogleMeetBackground.png)
